about: "Zak Saturday is the main protagonist of the Cartoon Network series The Secret Saturdays. He     is the 11-year-old (at debut as he later turns 12 and 13) son of Doc Saturday and his wife, Drew.

    Zak seeks adventure at every turn, which is easily satisfied by his cryptid-researching family. Zak has an unorthodox upbringing that has taken him around the world and placed him in the face of danger since the day he was born.

    He is voiced by Sam Lerner in the original series and by Ogie Banks in Ben 10: Omniverse. "
